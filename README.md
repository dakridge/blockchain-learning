# Blockchain Concepts

In order to better understand the concepts of the blockchain pattern used by so many cryptocurrencies, I wanted to try and build a simple one.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

You can run the script by running

```bash
node --experimental-modules dougcoin.js
```

You can also change the number of doug coins you want to mine and the difficulty in `dougcoin.js`.
